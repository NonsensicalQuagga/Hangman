**Introduction:**

The goal of this project is to recreate the game "Hangman".

**Background:**

I took the concept of the game hangman and divided it into smaller parts. 
Then I chose the part that felt most important/fun and created a file that did that task.

**Positive experiences:**

- I didn't spend multiple hours debugging things. 
- I could implement a solution to a problem with the wrong datatypes and Intellij would fix it so that it works for the datatypes given. (How I ended up using "Objects")

**Negative experiences:**

- I have no clue how to properly implement an array.
- File structure could be improved 

**Summery:**

I like what I've done. I can't say I have any important problems with it.
